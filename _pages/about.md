I am currently working at [Infolytx](https://www.infolytx.com/) as a Software Engineer-I. I completed my graduation from [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/) in Computer Science.

#### Who am I?

Once a poet, now a deep learning practitioner with a software engineering mindset. Therefore, I am a philosopher with a little bit of logical reasoning.
Currently focusing on deep diving into the things that I once said or believed I know.
